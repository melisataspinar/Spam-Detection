In this Python program, I implement Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes models to classify spam emails. 

To run the code, 
- unzip the dataset,
- make sure the dataset directory is right (change the "data_path" parameter in the "get_datasets" function, and make it the directory that you have put the datasets in, in your computer),
- use the command "python spam.py".

Also, note that the default value of alpha of Multinomial NB classifiers with Dirichlet is 0.
